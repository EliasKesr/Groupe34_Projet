# Data Engineering 

## Overview

This project focuses on text encoding using the Sentence Transformer model and applying three dimension reduction methods: PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE. The goal is to evaluate the methods using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) metrics. Additionally, a final step involves further reducing dimensions to 2D for cluster visualization.
